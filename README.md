# Variational Inference for Neyman-Scott Processes
## Instructions
### Dependency
- Anaconda (Python >= 3.8)
### Data
The data for retweets can be downloaded from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwqmV0EcoUc8UklIR1BKV25YR1U?resourcekey=0-OrlU87jyc1m-dVMmY5aC4w&usp=sharing), provided by Hongyuan Mei from the [Neural Hawkes Process](https://github.com/hongyuanmei/neurawkes).

The data for earthquakes and homicides can be downloaded from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ELuYM9qIj2hoSzJcYAs9UklcwO2WdTNu?usp=sharing).

The synthetic dataset can be downloaded from [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zFXdvVeCHCtu9xnhRI_F1odhnNGdIrxS?usp=share_link).
### Train
The modules should be added to PYTHONPATH first, e.g.,
```
export PYTHONPATH='./'
```
Training of 1-hidden for earthquakes with USAPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_1_hidden_general_virtual.py
```
Traning of 1-hidden for earthquakes with UNSPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_1_hidden_nsp_virtual.py
```
Training of 2-hidden for earthquakes with USAPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_2_hidden_general_virtual.py
```
Traning of 2-hidden for earthquakes with UNSPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_2_hidden_nsp_virtual.py
```
You can do the same things for retweets and homicides.

### Prediction
predict with 1-hidden MCMC
```
python earthquake_weibull_1_hidden_posterior_prediction.py
```
predict with 1-hidden UNSPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_1_hidden_virtual_nsp_prediction.py
```
predict with 1-hidden USAPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_1_hidden_virtual_general_prediction.py
```
predict with 2-hidden MCMC
```
python earthquake_weibull_2_hidden_posterior_prediction.py
```
predict with 2-hidden UNSPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_2_hidden_virtual_nsp_prediction.py
```
predict with 2-hidden USAPs
```
python earthquake_weibull_2_hidden_virtual_general_prediction.py
```
You can do the same things for retweets and homicides.
